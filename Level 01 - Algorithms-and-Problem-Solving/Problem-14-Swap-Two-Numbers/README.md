# Swap Two Numbers

## 🧠 Problem Description
This program reads two numbers from the user and swaps their values.  

The purpose of this problem is to demonstrate how to manipulate variables using a swap function and how to pass values by reference in C++.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadNumbers()**: Reads two integers from the user using reference parameters.  
- **Swap()**: Exchanges the values of the two integers using a temporary variable.  
- **PrintNumbers()**: Displays the numbers before and after swapping.  
- Functions are used to separate tasks clearly, improving code readability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Pass by reference  
- Variable manipulation  
- Temporary variables for swapping  
- Function-based program design  
- Standard input/output
