## 🧠 Problem Description
This program calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height.

The area is calculated using the formula:
$Area = \frac{1}{2} \times Base \times Height$

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadNumbers()**: Prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle.
- **TriangleArea()**: Applies the formula $(Base / 2) * Height$ to find the area.
- **PrintResult()**: Outputs the final result to the console.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Basic Arithmetic Operations
- Working with floating-point numbers (`float`)
- Function-based decomposition
- Input handling via reference parameters
