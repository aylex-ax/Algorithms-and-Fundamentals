# Problem 02: Read Name and Print It

## 📝 Description
A C++ program that prompts the user to enter their name and then displays it on the console. This problem focuses on implementing functions to handle input and output operations efficiently.

## 💡 Logic
The program structure consists of two main functions:
* **ReadName()**: Utilizes `getline` to ensure the full name is captured from the user.
* **PrintName()**: Receives the name as a string parameter and prints it to the screen.
