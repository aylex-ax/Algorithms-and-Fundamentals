# Maximum of Three Numbers

## 🧠 Problem Description
This program reads three numbers from the user and determines the maximum value among them.

The purpose of this problem is to demonstrate comparison logic using multiple conditions, along with clean input/output handling and structured program design in C++.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- The program reads three integers from the user.
- A series of conditional comparisons is used to determine the largest number.
- The result is displayed in a clear and simple format.
- Functions are used to separate input, processing, and output logic.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Nested conditional statements  
- Comparison operators  
- Pass by reference  
- Function-based program organization  
- Standard input/output
