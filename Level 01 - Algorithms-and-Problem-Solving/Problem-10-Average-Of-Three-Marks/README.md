# Average of Three Marks

## 🧠 Problem Description
This program reads three marks from a student and calculates the average.  

The goal is to demonstrate input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and function-based task separation in C++.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadMarks()**: Reads three marks from the user using reference parameters.  
- **SumOf3Marks()**: Calculates the total sum of the three marks.  
- **AverageOf3Marks()**: Computes the average by dividing the sum by 3.0.  
- **PrintResult()**: Displays the average mark.  
- Functions are used to separate tasks clearly, improving code readability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Pass by reference  
- Arithmetic operations (sum and average)  
- Function-based code organization  
- Standard input/output operations
