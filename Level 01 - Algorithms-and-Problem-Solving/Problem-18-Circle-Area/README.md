# Circle Area



## 🧠 Problem Description
This program calculates the area of a circle based on its radius provided by the user.

The area is calculated using the formula:
$Area = \pi \times R^2$

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadRadius()**: Prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle and returns it.
- **CircleArea()**: Defines a constant for $\pi$ and calculates the area using the radius squared ($R^2$).
- **PrintResult()**: Outputs the calculated area to the console.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Constants (`const`)
- Mathematical functions (`pow`) from `<cmath>`
- Function-based programming
- Floating-point precision
