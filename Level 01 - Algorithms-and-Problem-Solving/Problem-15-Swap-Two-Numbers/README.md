# Swap Two Numbers

## 🧠 Problem Description
This program reads two numbers from the user and swaps their values.  

The goal is to demonstrate variable manipulation using a swap function and passing values by reference in C++.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadNumbers()**: Reads two integers from the user using reference parameters.  
- **Swap()**: Exchanges the values of the two integers using a temporary variable.  
- **PrintNumbers()**: Displays the numbers before and after swapping.  
- Functions separate tasks clearly, improving readability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Pass by reference  
- Variable manipulation  
- Using a temporary variable for swapping  
- Function-based program design  
- Standard input/output
