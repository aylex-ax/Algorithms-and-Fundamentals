# Print Numbers From 1 to N



## 🧠 Problem Description
This program takes a number $N$ from the user and prints all numbers from $1$ to $N$ using three different types of loops: `while`, `do...while`, and `for`.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadNumber()**: Captures the upper limit $N$ from the user.
- **PrintFrom1ToN_UsingWhile()**: Uses a `while` loop, checking the condition before each iteration.
- **PrintFrom1ToN_UsingDoWhile()**: Uses a `do...while` loop, ensuring the code block runs at least once before checking the condition.
- **PrintFrom1ToN_UsingFor()**: Uses a `for` loop, which is the most concise way to handle range-based iterations.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- **Iteration & Loops**
- **While Loop**: Pre-test loop.
- **Do-While Loop**: Post-test loop.
- **For Loop**: Control variable based loop.
- Function Overloading/Modular logic.
