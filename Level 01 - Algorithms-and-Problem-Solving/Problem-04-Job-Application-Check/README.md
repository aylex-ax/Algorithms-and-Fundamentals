# Job Application Eligibility Check

## 🧠 Problem Description
This C++ program reads the user's age and driving license status, then determines whether the applicant is **accepted (Hired)** or **rejected** based on predefined criteria.

## ⚙️ Solution Approach
- The program uses a `struct` to store the applicant's information (`Age` and `HasDrivingLicense`).
- **ReadInfo()**: Reads the user's age and driving license status.
- **IsAccepted()**: Checks if the applicant is older than 21 and has a driving license.
- **PrintResult()**: Prints "Hired" if the applicant meets the criteria, otherwise "Rejected".
