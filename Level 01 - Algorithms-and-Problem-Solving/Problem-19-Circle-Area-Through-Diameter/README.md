## 🧠 Problem Description
This program calculates the area of a circle using its diameter length provided by the user.

The area is calculated using the formula:
$Area = \frac{\pi \times D^2}{4}$

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadDiameter()**: Prompts the user to enter the diameter of the circle.
- **CircleAreaByDiameter()**: Implements the mathematical formula using the diameter and a constant for $\pi$.
- **PrintResult()**: Displays the final area calculation.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Mathematical Modeling
- Using `pow()` for exponents
- Handling floating-point division
- Modular programming (Function separation)
