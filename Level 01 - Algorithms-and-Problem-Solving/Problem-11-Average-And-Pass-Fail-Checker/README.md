# Average and Pass/Fail Checker

## 🧠 Problem Description
This program reads three marks from the user, calculates their average, and determines whether the result is a **Pass** or **Fail** based on a predefined threshold.

The purpose of this problem is to demonstrate how multiple logical steps can be combined together, including calculation, decision-making, and result presentation.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- The program reads three marks from the user.
- It calculates the total sum and then computes the average.
- An `enum` is used to represent the result status (Pass or Fail).
- The average is evaluated against a passing threshold.
- The final result is printed in a clear and readable format.
- Functions are used to separate responsibilities and improve code structure.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Enumerations (enum)  
- Arithmetic operations (sum and average)  
- Conditional logic  
- Function-based program design  
- Pass by reference
