# Pass or Fail Checker

## 🧠 Problem Description
This program reads a student's mark and determines whether the student **passed** or **failed** based on a predefined threshold.  

The goal is to demonstrate the use of enumerations, conditional logic, and function-based code organization in C++.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadMark()**: Reads the student's mark from the user.
- **CheckMark()**: Compares the mark to the passing threshold and returns an `enum` value (Pass or Fail).
- **PrintResult()**: Prints whether the student passed or failed.
- Functions and enums are used to separate concerns, improve code clarity, and enhance maintainability.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Enumerations (enum)  
- Conditional logic  
- Function-based task separation  
- Standard input/output operations
