## 🧠 Problem Description
This program calculates the area of a circle based on its circumference length provided by the user.

The area is calculated using the formula:
$Area = \frac{L^2}{4 \pi}$
*(Where $L$ is the circumference)*.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **readCircumference()**: Prompts the user to enter the circumference and returns it as a `double`.
- **calculateCircleArea()**: Uses a high-precision constant for $\pi$ and calculates the area using the squared circumference divided by $4\pi$.
- **printResult()**: Displays the final area calculation with high precision.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- High-precision data types (`double`)
- Advanced mathematical formulas
- Constants for mathematical accuracy
- Clean code with functional decomposition
