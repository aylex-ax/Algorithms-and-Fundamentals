# Calculate Half of a Number

## 🧠 Problem Description
This program is designed to read an integer from the user and calculate its half.  

The goal is to demonstrate basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and function-based task separation in C++.

## ⚙️ Solution Overview
- **ReadNumber()**: Reads an integer input from the user.
- **CalculateHalfNumber()**: Computes half of the given number.
- **PrintResult()**: Outputs the original number along with its half.
- Functions are used to separate tasks clearly, improving readability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- Standard input/output operations
- Arithmetic operations with integers and floats
- Function-based code organization
